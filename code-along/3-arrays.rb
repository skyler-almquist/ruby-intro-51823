# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = [[
    "tacos", "burrito", "sushi"], ["burgers", "nachos"]]

    numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

# puts favorite_foods.inspect

# puts numbers.inspect

# Accessing the array
# puts favorite_foods[0]
# puts favorite_foods[1][1]

# Add to the array
favorite_foods = favorite_foods + ["fries", "ramen"]
puts favorite_foods.inspect

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
