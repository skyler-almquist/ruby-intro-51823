# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts 5

# Perform simple math with numbers
#puts 5*4

#puts 5.0/3.0


# Strings
#puts "hello world!"


# Combine strings together
#puts "tacos " + "are awesome"
#puts "tacos " * 3

# Variables
food = "tacos"
puts food
x = 10
y = 3



# Combine strings and variables
puts "my favorite meal is " + food
puts "#{x + y} tacos"
